    It actually sounds nice and reassuring. The fact that code can never lie.
    That a computer executes exactly what we ask it to, and to fix a bug or
    add a feature, we can just read the pertinent files and lines of code and
    be done with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this can rarely be accomplished by rushing the keyboard and
    coding the first thing that comes to mind, as the developer that has to
    work with your code; or even yourself after a couple of weeks, will be
    received by a web of lies and deception of a lazily written program.

  <p>
    <b>My goal</b> is to keep learning about the best practices to write
    robust, human friendly code while preaching to my peers what I have
    learned throughout these years about <b>Clean Code</b> and being a
    <b>Clean Coder</b>.

    Decided to test myself in a smaller business where my decitions would have a
    bigger impact on success. This time, having a higher influence regarding which technologies
    to be used to meet the product's interests. A higher seniority has given me the chance to
    guide teammates who are yet not as battleworn in the software development business.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given that the company is considered a 'Startup' and that the amount of tasks
    is distributed among a smaller number of developers. I could get involved
    successfully as fullstack developer.

    Started developing one of the company's games in Unity until I
    was relocated to the <b>Platform Team</b>, dedicated to develop
    services and tools for other teams in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
    My two biggest projects consisted of; a dependency manager for
    Unity in which code and libraries could be distributed and
    versioned for everyone; and an Ad service which eased the
    implementation of various Ad networks, increasing revenue
    through ads.

    I'm thankful to this firm for the exponential growth I could
    show through my time there. Learning and implementing TDD, DDD,
    microservices, functional programming, etc. As well as starting
    my career as a Clean Code enthusiast.
