The fact that code can never lie.\r\n      That a computer executes exactly what we ask it to, and to fix a bug or\r\n      add a feature, we can just read the pertinent files and lines of code and\r\n      be done with it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      However, this can rarely be accomplished by rushing the keyboard and\r\n      coding the first thing that comes to mind, as the developer that has to\r\n      work with your code; or even yourself after a couple of weeks, will be\r\n      received by a web of lies and deception of a lazily written program.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p>\r\n      <b>My goal</b> is to keep learning about the best practices to write\r\n      robust, human friendly code while preaching to my peers what I have\r\n      learned throughout these years about <b>Clean Code</b> and being a\r\n      <b>Clean Coder</b>.\r\n    </p>"
