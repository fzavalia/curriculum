    It actually sounds nice and reassuring. The fact that code can never lie.
    That a computer executes exactly what we ask it to, and to fix a bug or
    add a feature, we can just read the pertinent files and lines of code and
    be done with it.

    However, this can rarely be accomplished by rushing the keyboard and
    coding the first thing that comes to mind, as the developer that has to
    work with your code; or even yourself after a couple of weeks, will be
    received by a web of lies and deception of a lazily written program.

    <b>My goal</b> is to keep learning about the best practices to write
    robust, human friendly code while preaching to my peers what I have
    learned throughout these years about <b>Clean Code</b> and being a
    <b>Clean Coder</b>.
