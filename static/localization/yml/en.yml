    It actually sounds nice and reassuring. The fact that code can never lie.
    That a computer executes exactly what we ask it to, and to fix a bug or
    add a feature, we can just read the pertinent files and lines of code and
    be done with it.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this can rarely be accomplished by rushing the keyboard and
    coding the first thing that comes to mind, as the developer that has to
    work with your code; or even yourself after a couple of weeks, will be
    received by a web of lies and deception of a lazily written program.

    <b>My goal</b> is to keep learning about the best practices to write
    robust, human friendly code while preaching to my peers what I have
    learned throughout these years about <b>Clean Code</b> and being a
    <b>Clean Coder</b>.

  <span>Lead Front Developer | FullStack</span>
  <p>
    Decided to test myself with a leadership role of a small team.
    With all decisions, concerning the frontend of our applications
    going through my person, I can finally transmit what I learned
    this past years to people who were at my same rookie position on
    days past.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given the status of "Startup" the company has, and the increased
    amount of responsibilities the small team has to handle, I could
    prove myself successfully in the backend and infrastructure.

  <span>Software Engineer</span>
  <p>
    Started developing one of the company's games in Unity until I
    was relocated to the <b>Platform Team</b>, dedicated to develop
    services and tools for other teams in the company.
  </p>
  <p>
    My two biggest projects consisted of; a dependency manager for
    Unity in which code and libraries could be distributed and
    versioned for everyone; and an Ad service which eased the
    implementation of various Ad networks, increasing revenue
    through ads.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm thankful to this firm for the exponential growth I could
    show through my time there. Learning and implementing TDD, DDD,
    microservices, functional programming, etc. As well as starting
    my career as a Clean Code enthusiast.
